Both this server and String"https://suipe53w4l.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/stageName/";
act the same

Server can take post request to:
	/new/deviceName
		-server checks to make sure it doesnt already have device and replies saying added
	/set/deviceName/value- either the device is saying im now this, or a remote is saying change state
		reply saying you updated the value in databse
	/delete/deviceName

server can take get request to:
	/	
		return a ping if no path specified
	/deviceName
		returns its state {1or0}
	/all returns all devices states
		{deviceName:state,deviceName:state}
	/!deviceName/{any other command}
		!deviceName is letting server know who made the request


if server doesnt receive request from a device in N seconds then remove it from list
